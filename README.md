## Sentiment Analysis Tool - Real-Time Market Trends

It involves the development of an iOS application that combines a SwiftUI front-end with a Python back-end, connected through a REST API.

### Purpose and Functionality
The main objective of this project is to create a powerful sentiment analysis tool that tracks real-time market trends. The application offers an interactive user interface, providing users with access to top headlines and sentiment distributions displayed through intuitive charts and graphs. This empowers users to gain valuable insights into market sentiment related to various financial assets and market indicators.

### Front-end Development
The front-end development was carried out using SwiftUI, a modern and versatile framework for building captivating user interfaces in iOS applications. SwiftUI allowed me to craft visually appealing screens and create a seamless integration with the application's underlying functionality. The result is an interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

### Back-end Implementation
The back-end of the application was implemented in Python, leveraging its extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools. I utilized Python's NLTK library for robust natural language processing and Flask framework for constructing the REST API. These technologies facilitated efficient data processing and analysis, enabling the application to handle large volumes of financial news articles gathered through web scraping techniques.

### Real-time Sentiment Analysis
The application utilizes sentiment analysis algorithms to assess the sentiment associated with each financial news article. By analyzing the sentiment of these articles, the application generates valuable insights into market trends and sentiment patterns. The sentiment data is then visualized using charts and graphs, providing users with an intuitive representation of the current market sentiment.

## Advanced Functionality
The application offers advanced features such as customizable preferences, allowing users to track sentiment trends for specific financial assets or market sectors. Additionally, users can opt to receive notifications for significant changes in sentiment or important news updates, ensuring they stay informed about the latest market developments.
